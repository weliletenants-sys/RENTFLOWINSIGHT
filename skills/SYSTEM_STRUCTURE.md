## 1. Platform Overview

### 1.1 Business Model

Welile facilitates rent by connecting:

| Actor | Role |
|---|---|
| **Tenant** | Requests rent access; repays in daily instalments |
| **Landlord** | Receives verified rent payments; lists houses |
| **Agent** | Field operator — verifies tenants/landlords, collects payments, earns commissions |
| **Supporter (Funder)** | Provides upfront rent capital; earns ROI via repayment streams |
| **Manager / Executive** | Oversees operations, approvals, risk, and solvency |

Welile earns fees for infrastructure and guarantees. It does **not** sell loans — it facilitates rent and manages risk.

### 1.2 Core Product Flows

1. **Tenant applies for rent** → Agent verifies → Manager approves → Supporter funds → Landlord receives rent
2. **Tenant repays daily** → Agent collects → Platform distributes to supporter + fees
3. **Supporter earns ROI** on funded rent through structured repayment streams
4. **Agent earns commissions** on registrations, collections, and verifications

### 1.3 Key Metrics (North Star)

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rent Secured (UGX/month)** | North Star metric |
| Active Virtual Houses | Houses with active rent coverage |
| Rent Success Rate | % of rent requests fully repaid |
| Payment Health Distribution | Breakdown of on-time vs late vs default |
| Capital Utilization | % of supporter capital actively deployed |
| Liquidity Buffer | Platform reserve coverage ratio |
| Default Rate | % of rent requests that defaulted |
| Cache Hit Rate | Target ≥ 90% |

---

## 2. Technology Stack

### 2.1 Frontend

| Routing | React Router v6 |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Maps | Leaflet + React Leaflet + PostGIS |
| PDF Generation | jsPDF |
| QR Codes | html5-qrcode, qrcode.react |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa (Service Worker) |
| Offline Storage | IndexedDB + localStorage |

### 2.2 Backend (Lovable Cloud / Supabase)

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|

| Africa's Talking | SMS OTP, payment reminders, collection SMS |
| Lovable Email | Auth emails, agreement copies, notifications |
| PostGIS | Geospatial queries for nearby house discovery |
| Web Push (VAPID) | Push notifications |

---

## 3. Authentication & Role System

### 3.1 Auth Flow

```
User → Email/Phone + Password → Supabase Auth
     → OTP Login (SMS via Africa's Talking)
     → Password Reset (SMS-based)
     → Session persisted in localStorage
     → Auto-refresh tokens
```

**Key files:**
- `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` — Auth context provider
- `src/hooks/auth/roleManager.ts` — Role provisioning logic
- `src/hooks/auth/authOperations.ts` — Sign-in/out operations
- `src/lib/sessionCache.ts` — Session caching for instant boot

### 3.2 Role Definitions (14 Roles)

| Category | Roles |
|---|---|
| **Consumer** | `tenant`, `landlord`, `supporter`, `agent` |
| **Staff** | `manager`, `operations`, `employee` |
| **Executive** | `ceo`, `coo`, `cfo`, `cto`, `cmo`, `crm` |
| **System** | `super_admin` (God mode) |

Roles are stored in a **separate `user_roles` table** (never on the profile) with a `has_role()` security definer function to prevent recursive RLS.

### 3.3 Role Provisioning

- **Default roles:** New users receive `supporter`, `agent`, `tenant`, `landlord`
- **Internal/executive roles:** Assigned manually by `super_admin`, `manager`, or `cto` (requires authorization code)
- **Soft-delete:** Removing a role sets `enabled = false` instead of hard-deleting, preventing auto-reprovisioning on next login
- **Role Access Requests:** Tenants/agents can request access to additional dashboards; managers approve/deny

### 3.4 Dashboard Auto-Routing

```
Login → Check deployed capital
      → If ≥ UGX 100,000 → Default to Supporter dashboard
      → Otherwise → Check user's "Home Screen" preference
      → If "Auto" → Route to first available role
      → Staff roles → Auto-redirect to /staff portal
```

### 3.5 Staff Portal Isolation

Internal staff access is isolated via `/staff` route — a dedicated entry point for administrative roles. It performs post-login role verification and auto-redirects to the appropriate dashboard while rejecting unauthorized users. Administrative UI elements are **completely hidden** from consumer-facing views.

## 5. Financial Engine & Ledger

### 5.1 Core Principle

> **All money movement MUST go through an append-only, double-entry ledger. Balances must NEVER be stored or edited directly.**

### 5.2 Ledger Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ledger_accounts` | Account registry (user wallets, system accounts, obligations) |
| `ledger_transactions` | Transaction headers (metadata, approval status) |
| `ledger_entries` | Individual debit/credit entries (append-only, immutable) |
| `general_ledger` | Central view combining all entries |
| `transaction_approvals` | Multi-stage approval records |

### 5.3 Account Hierarchy

| Group | Purpose | Negative Allowed |
|---|---|---|
| `USER_OWNED` | User wallets (supporter, tenant, agent, landlord) | ❌ Never |
| `OBLIGATION` | Debts, rent obligations, commitments | ✅ Yes |
| `SYSTEM_CONTROL` | Buffer accounts, escrow, rent pool | Depends |
| `REVENUE` | Deferred revenue, recognized revenue | Depends |
| `EXPENSE` | Costs, rewards, commissions | Depends |
| `SETTLEMENT` | Banking, mobile money settlement | Depends |

Standard templates: `SUPPORTER_WALLET`, `TENANT_RENT_OBLIGATION`, `BUFFER_ACCOUNT`

### 5.4 Wallet Synchronization

The `sync_wallet_from_ledger` database trigger automatically updates user wallet balances whenever a ledger entry with a `transaction_group_id` is inserted. This ensures wallets **always** reflect the ledger truth.

### 5.5 Ledger Scoping

Every ledger entry has a `ledger_scope`:

| Scope | Visibility | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `wallet` | User-facing | Deposit, withdrawal, rent payment received |
| `platform` | Internal only | Pool deployments, internal transfers |
| `bridge` | Both | Capital inflows affecting both user and platform |

User wallet history **explicitly excludes** `platform` scope entries and any transaction with description starting with "pool deployment".

### 5.6 Financial Safety Controls

- **Optimistic Locking:** Edge Functions verify wallet balance matches expected state before committing
- **60-Second Cooldown:** Rapid-fire protection on financial operations
- **Rollback Mechanism:** Restores balances if subsequent operations fail
- **No Direct Balance Edits:** Managers cannot manually adjust balances; all changes via approved workflows
- **Ledger UI is Read-Only:** RLS prevents direct table updates

### 5.7 Risk & Solvency

- Buffer/escrow accounts maintained with coverage ratios
- Liquidity indicators monitored continuously
- If coverage drops below safe levels → system flags, alerts managers, and halts risky operations
- **Solvency > Growth** (non-negotiable)

---

## 6. Rent Request Pipeline

### 6.1 Six-Stage Approval Pipeline

```
Stage 1: Tenant Ops      → Agent assignment (Haversine distance)
Stage 2: Agent Ops        → Field verification (GPS, photos, signatures)
Stage 3: Landlord Ops     → Landlord verification
Stage 4: COO              → Operational sign-off
Stage 5: CFO              → Financial authorization
Stage 6: Disbursed        → Payout to landlord
```

This pipeline is the **primary operational priority** — positioned at the top of all executive dashboards.

### 6.2 Key Supporting Tables

- `rent_requests` — Core request tracking
- `credit_request_details` — Extended verification data (GPS, meter numbers, landlord info)
- `disbursement_records` — Payment delivery tracking
- `agent_delivery_confirmations` — Agent proof of delivery (photos, GPS, signatures)

### 6.3 Repayment Structure

- Daily instalments via approved payment channels (Mobile Money)
- Agent-collected payments tracked via `agent_collections`
- Collection streaks and incentive bonuses for agents
- Payment tokens for secure transaction verification

## 8. Data Architecture & Scaling

### 8.1 Database Design Principles

- **No foreign keys to `auth.users`** — User references go through `profiles` table
- **Profiles table** in public schema stores accessible user data (name, phone, avatar, verification status)
- **Nullable/default columns** considered on every table to prevent insert errors
- **Append-only** for all financial tables (no updates, no deletes)

### 8.2 Scaling Strategies (40M+ Users)

| Strategy | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **GIN Trigram Indexes** | Phone suffix searches (`pg_trgm` extension) |
| **PostGIS Spatial Indexes** | GIST indexes for nearby property discovery |
| **Recursive Fetching** | `.range()` logic to bypass 1,000-row default limit |
| **Batched IN Clauses** | Chunk ID sets into batches of 50 to prevent URL-too-long errors |
| **Server-Side Pagination** | `search_users_paginated` RPC for large user tables |
| **Approximate Counts** | `pg_class` for dashboard estimates |
| **Snapshot Caching** | 4-hour snapshots via `daily_platform_stats` |
| **Materialized Views** | Pre-computed aggregates with SELECT revoked from public/anon |

**Utility:** `src/lib/supabaseBatchUtils.ts` — Centralized batch fetching utilities

### 8.3 Key Database Tables (Partial)

#### Core

## 9. Real-Time & Offline-First

### 9.1 Real-Time (Selective)

To maintain stability at scale, real-time is limited to **5 mission-critical tables:**

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `messages` | Chat |
| `wallets` | Balance updates |
| `force_refresh_signals` | Admin-triggered refreshes |
| `rent_requests` | Rent lifecycle updates |
| `profiles` | New user registrations |

A **global realtime kill switch** (`src/lib/disableRealtime.ts`) can silence all subscriptions.

### 9.2 Offline-First Architecture (WhatsApp-Style)

**Pattern:** Read from localStorage instantly → show stale data → background-fetch → update cache silently

| Component | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `useLocalFirstQuery` hook | Universal local-first data loading |
| `offlineDataStorage.ts` | IndexedDB persistence layer |
| `OfflineContext` | Global offline state management |
| Service Worker | PWA caching, offline page shell |
| `OfflineBanner` | Visual offline indicator |

**Applied to:** All consumer dashboards (Tenant, Supporter, Agent, Landlord), Settings page, Profile data

### 9.3 Performance Characteristics

- Dashboards paint instantly from cache, even on 2G networks
- Network fetch happens silently in background
- 5-minute stale time before re-fetching
- localStorage + in-memory cache dual layer
- Cache eviction when storage is full (oldest entries first)

---

## 10. Email & Notifications

### 10.1 Auth Emails

- Powered by Lovable Email Infrastructure
- React Email templates in `supabase/functions/_shared/email-templates/`
- Templates: Signup confirmation, password recovery, magic link, invite, email change, reauthentication
- Sender domain: `notify.welile.com` (from: `noreply@welile.com`)
- Queued via pgmq (`auth_emails` queue) for retry safety

### 10.2 Transactional Emails

- Supporter Agreement copy sent automatically on acceptance
- Queued via pgmq (`transactional_emails` queue)
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate sends
- Dead-letter queue after 5 failed attempts

### 10.3 SMS Notifications

---

## 11. Security & RLS

### 11.1 Row-Level Security (RLS) Architecture

- **All tables** have RLS enabled
- `has_role()` security definer function prevents recursive RLS checks
- System-only tables explicitly deny direct client-side writes
- OTP verifications have deny-all policy for authenticated users
- Materialized views have SELECT revoked from public/anon

### 11.2 Edge Function Security Pattern

```
Anon Client    → Verifies caller identity (auth.getUser())
Service Client → Performs data operations (bypasses RLS)
```

- UUID validation on all inputs
- Character limits enforced
- CORS headers include required Supabase client headers

### 11.3 Administrative Permission Matrix

| Action | Allowed Roles |
|---|---|
| Role assignment | `super_admin`, `manager`, `cto` |
| Operations dept mapping | `super_admin`, `manager`, `cto` |
| Account freeze/delete | `super_admin`, `manager`, `cto`, `coo` |
| Deposit approval | `manager`, `coo` |
| Withdrawal Stage 2 | `cfo` |
| Withdrawal Stage 4 | `coo` |

### 11.4 Consumer Isolation

- Supporters **never** see tenants, landlords, agents, user lists, names, phones, or IDs
- Supporters only see: Virtual Houses, rent amount, payment health, portfolio performance
- Tenants/landlords see only their own status and schedules
- Agents see only their registrations, tasks, earnings, and zones
- Admin UI elements completely hidden from consumer views

### 11.5 Financial Security

- No direct wallet/ledger updates via client
- All financial operations go through service-role Edge Functions
- Optimistic locking prevents race conditions
- 60-second cooldown on financial operations
- Append-only ledger (no updates, no deletes)

---

## 12. UI/UX Architecture

### 12.1 Design System

- **CSS Variables:** HSL-based semantic tokens in `index.css`

## 14. Governance & Compliance

### 14.1 Audit Trail

- **`audit_logs` table** captures all sensitive actions
- Fields: `user_id`, `action_type`, `table_name`, `record_id`, `metadata`, `timestamp`
- Investment account changes require 10-character minimum audit reason
- All manager actions logged with full context

### 14.2 Legal Agreements

| Agreement | Role | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant Agreement | Tenant | Must accept before rent requests |
| Agent Agreement | Agent | Must accept before field operations |
| Supporter Agreement | Supporter | One-time acceptance; email copy auto-sent |
| Landlord Agreement | Landlord | Must accept before listing |

Agreement acceptance records stored with IP address, device info, timestamp, and version.

### 14.3 Staff Performance Monitoring

- CEO and COO access Staff Performance panel
- Audit log heatmaps showing daily activity
- SLA compliance tracking (idle time, response rates)
- Per-staff operation metrics

### 14.4 Governing Principles

1. **Dignity before growth**
2. **Systems over heroics**
3. **Calm over urgency**
4. **Trust over shortcuts**
5. **Outcomes over optics**
6. **Auditability over convenience**

### 14.5 Conflict Resolution Rules

| Conflict | Winner |
|---|---|
| Speed vs Correctness | Correctness |
| Growth vs Solvency | Solvency |
| Convenience vs Auditability | Auditability |
| Emotion vs Principle | Principle |

---

## 15. Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| DB reads per session | ≤ 3 |
| Cache hit rate | ≥ 90% |
| Edge function p95 latency | < 300ms |
| DB latency (healthy) | < 300ms |
| DB latency (degraded) | > 1000ms |
| Dashboard initial paint | < 1s (from cache) |
| Snapshots | Rebuildable at any time |
| Import timeout | 25s (for slow networks) |
| Realtime tables | Max 5 (whitelisted) |

---

## 16. Forbidden Anti-Patterns

These patterns are **strictly prohibited** across the entire codebase:

| Anti-Pattern | Why |
|---|---|
| Editable wallet balances | Balances are ledger-derived, never stored directly |
| "Fix balance" buttons | All corrections via reversing ledger entries |
| Manual balance adjustments | No manager can directly edit a balance |
| User lists in supporter UI | Supporters see only anonymized virtual houses |
| Revenue without fulfillment | Revenue recognized only when service obligation met |
| Silent financial corrections | Every correction must be auditable |
| Logic bypassing ledger | If money moves without ledger entries, it's invalid |
| Direct `auth.users` queries | Use `profiles` table instead |
| Hardcoded admin checks (localStorage) | Always server-side role verification |
| `find /` or full filesystem scans | Scope all searches to project directory |
| Anonymous signups | Always standard email/password auth |
| Storing roles on profiles table | Roles in separate `user_roles` table only |
